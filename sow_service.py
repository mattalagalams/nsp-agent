üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Based on analysis of {filename}, we've identified 4 high-impact Azure opportunities with potential annual savings of $180,000 and improved operational efficiency of 40%.

Key Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Migrate current infrastructure to Azure App Service - 35% cost reduction
‚Ä¢ Implement Azure SQL Database with automatic tuning - 50% performance improvement  
‚Ä¢ Deploy Azure AI Document Intelligence - 60% faster document processing
‚Ä¢ Add Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline - 80% faster deployment cycles

üîç SOW ANALYSIS FINDINGS

Project Overview:
- Web application modernization project
- Current hosting on legacy on-premises servers
- Microsoft SQL Server 2016 database
- Manual deployment processes
- Document-heavy workflows requiring processing

Current State Challenges:
